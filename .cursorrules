description: Applies general Python development guidelines including typing, docstrings, dependency management, testing with pytest, and code style using Ruff.
globs: **/*.py
---
- For any python file, be sure to ALWAYS add typing annotations to each function or class. Be sure to include return types when necessary.
- Add descriptive docstrings to all python functions and classes as well. Please use pep257 convention. Update existing docstrings if need be.
- Make sure you keep any comments that exist in a file.
- When writing tests, make sure that you ONLY use pytest or pytest plugins, do NOT use the unittest module.
- All tests should have typing annotations as well.
- All tests should be in ./tests. Be sure to create all necessary files and folders. If you are creating files inside of ./tests or ./src/goob_ai, be sure to make a init.py file if one does not exist.
- All tests should be fully annotated and should contain docstrings.
- Be sure to import the following if TYPE_CHECKING:
  from _pytest.capture import CaptureFixture
  from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest
  from _pytest.logging import LogCaptureFixture
  from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch
  from pytest_mock.plugin import MockerFixture
- Dependency management via https://github.com/astral-sh/uv and virtual environments.
- Code style consistency using Ruff.

description: Use Snyk CLI for vulnerability scanning and security testing.
globs: *
---
- Run Snyk CLI vulnerability scans before deploying code changes.
- Execute `snyk test` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- Use `snyk monitor` to continuously monitor projects for new vulnerabilities.
- Integrate Snyk testing into CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks.
- Address high-severity vulnerabilities promptly following Snyk recommendations.
- Keep dependencies updated based on Snyk security advisories.
- Run `snyk code test` for static application security testing (SAST).
- Generate and review Snyk test reports for security compliance.

---
description: Requires comprehensive documentation for all features and changes.
alwaysApply: true
---
- Create detailed implementation documents in the docs folder for all new features and major changes.
- Implementation docs should include:
  - Overview and purpose
  - Technical design and architecture
  - Dependencies and requirements
  - Implementation details and code examples
  - Configuration and setup instructions
  - Testing approach and considerations
  - Security implications if applicable
  - Performance considerations
  - Migration steps if needed
- Update enhancements.md to track feature additions and improvements.
- Maintain clear and organized documentation structure in the docs folder.
- Include API documentation for public interfaces.
- Document configuration options and environment variables.
- Add usage examples and common scenarios.
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes.
- Review and update existing documentation when making related changes.
- Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date with all completed features, bug fixes, and changes.
- Use enhancements.md only for tracking planned or in-progress enhancements and features.
- When an enhancement or feature is completed, summarize it and move the entry from enhancements.md to CHANGELOG.md.
- Ensure that enhancements.md reflects only current and future work, not completed items.
- Regularly review and reconcile enhancements.md and CHANGELOG.md to maintain accuracy and clarity in project history.

description: Use pdoc for HTML API documentation and pydoc-markdown for high-quality Markdown export for AI ingestion, ensuring discoverability.
globs: **/*.py
---
- Generate API documentation using pdoc for all Python modules and packages (HTML only).
- Export API documentation in both HTML and Markdown formats:
  - Use `pdoc --html` for HTML documentation.
  - Output HTML to `docs/api`.
  - Use `pydoc-markdown` for Markdown documentation suitable for AI ingestion.
  - Output Markdown to `docs/api_markdown`.
- Ensure comprehensive docstrings are present for:
  - All modules
  - All classes and their methods
  - All functions and their parameters
  - All package-level documentation
- Docstrings should follow Google style format and include:
  - Description of functionality
  - Args/Parameters with types
  - Returns with types
  - Raises exceptions if applicable
  - Examples where helpful
- Run documentation generation after code changes:
  - Use `pdoc --html` for HTML documentation
  - Use `pdoc --output-dir docs/api` for HTML
  - Use `pydoc-markdown` to generate Markdown documentation
  - Use `pydoc-markdown -I src -m <your_module> -o docs/api_markdown` (adjust as needed)
  - Configure both tools to match project theme and style
- Keep API documentation synchronized with implementation:
  - Update docstrings when changing function signatures
  - Maintain accurate parameter descriptions
  - Document breaking changes and deprecations
  - Version documentation alongside code
- Include doctest examples in docstrings where applicable
- Review generated documentation for completeness and accuracy
- Link API documentation in project README and documentation index
- Add a prominent note in documentation and README to direct AI and users to the Markdown API docs in `docs/api_markdown` for optimal AI ingestion and reference.

description: Use of GitHub CLI for managing PR's
globs: *
---
- When creating pull requests with the GitHub CLI, always generate a temporary Markdown-formatted file for the PR body.
- Use the `--body-file` option with `gh pr create` to supply the PR body, ensuring proper formatting and avoiding shell escaping issues.
- Do not use inline `--body` arguments for PR creation; always prefer the file-based approach for clarity and reliability.
- Example workflow:
  - Write the PR description to a temporary file (e.g., `.pr-body.md`).
  - Run: `gh pr create --body-file .pr-body.md [other options]`
  - Always remove the temporary file after PR creation.
- This approach ensures consistent, readable PR descriptions and prevents issues with special characters or formatting in shell commands.

---
description: Branch managment procedures
globs: *
---
- Always create a new branch for each bug, feature, or change. Do not work directly on the main branch.
- Follow this workflow for every change:
  1. Identify the bug or required change and open a corresponding GitHub issue for tracking.
  2. Create a new branch from the latest main, named after the issue (e.g., `bugfix/issue-123-description` or `feature/issue-456-description`).
  3. Make code changes in the new branch.
  4. Write or update tests to cover the change.
  5. Update documentation, including implementation docs in `docs/`, and update `enhancements.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` as appropriate.
  6. Commit changes with clear, issue-referencing messages.
  7. Push the branch to the remote repository.
  8. Create a pull request referencing the related issue, using a Markdown-formatted file for the PR body with the GitHub CLI (`--body-file`).
  9. After review and merge, delete the feature/bugfix branch.
- This process ensures clean branch history, traceability, and up-to-date documentation for every change.
