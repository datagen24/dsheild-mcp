## 10. MCP-Shield Security Integration (In Progress)

**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress as of 2025-01-27

**Summary:**
Integration of MCP-Shield security scanner to enhance the security posture of the DShield MCP project. MCP-Shield detects vulnerabilities in MCP servers including tool poisoning attacks, exfiltration channels, and cross-origin escalations.

**Implementation Plan:**

### Phase 1: External Security Scanner (Immediate)
- [x] Create comprehensive analysis document (`docs/MCP_SHIELD_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`)
- [x] Implement Python integration script (`scripts/security_scan.py`)
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`)
- [x] Develop security validation module (`src/security_validator.py`)
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_security.py`)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security Validation (Short-term)
- [ ] Integrate security validation into MCP server tool registration
- [ ] Add real-time security monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Implement security metrics collection and reporting
- [ ] Create security dashboard for monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Security Features (Long-term)
- [ ] Custom security rules for DShield-specific patterns
- [ ] Automated security issue remediation
- [ ] Security training and guidelines
- [ ] Continuous security improvement processes
