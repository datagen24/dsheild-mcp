- Completed features must be moved to CHANGELOG.md.
- Should not contain completed items.
- Regularly reconcile with CHANGELOG.md for accuracy.

### CHANGELOG.md (docs/CHANGELOG.md)
- Summarizes all completed features, bug fixes, and changes.
- Entries should be clear and reference related issues/PRs if possible.
- When a feature is completed, summarize it and move the entry from Enhancements.md to CHANGELOG.md.

### API Documentation (docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md, docs/api/index.html)
- Provide comprehensive descriptions for all tools and public interfaces.
- Include input schemas, usage examples, and security considerations.
- Document limitations and compatibility requirements.
- Ensure API docs are up to date with the codebase.

### Usage and Configuration Docs (README.md, docs/USAGE.md, docs/README.md)
- Provide clear setup instructions for different environments.
- Document all environment variables and configuration options with examples.
- Include usage examples and troubleshooting guides.
- Document advanced configuration and output directory options.

### Security, Performance, and Migration
- Security implications and best practices must be documented for all sensitive features.
- Performance characteristics and resource requirements should be included where relevant.
- Migration steps must be documented for breaking changes or protocol updates.

### Documentation Structure and Index
- docs/README.md should provide a clear index to all documentation resources.
- Documentation should be organized and discoverable.

---

## Step 2: Inventory of Existing Documentation

### Main Documentation Files

- **README.md** (project root): Project overview, features, quick start, configuration, security, usage examples, and development setup.
- **docs/README.md**: Documentation index and overview (should provide links to all major documentation resources).
- **docs/USAGE.md**: Detailed usage guide and API reference.
- **docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md**: API reference for developers and integrators.
- **docs/api/index.html** and related files: Auto-generated HTML API documentation.
- **docs/Enhancements.md**: Tracks planned and in-progress enhancements and features.
- **docs/CHANGELOG.md**: Summarizes completed features, bug fixes, and changes.
- **docs/Implementation_Docs/**: Contains detailed implementation docs for features and major changes (multiple files, e.g., ATTACK_REPORT_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md, CAMPAIGN_ANALYSIS_IMPLEMENTATION.md, etc.).
- **docs/Implementation_Docs/Archived/**: Archived implementation and bug report documents.
- **docs/OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_CONFIGURATION.md**: Output directory configuration details.
- **docs/MCP_SHIELD_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md**: Analysis of MCP Shield integration.
- **docs/performance_metrics.md**: Performance metrics and considerations.
- **docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.md**: Release notes for v1.0.

### Other Documentation Resources

- **examples/**: Contains example scripts for basic usage, data dictionary, threat intelligence, and LaTeX template usage.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for building API docs and security scanning.

### Notes on Documentation Status

- Implementation docs are present for multiple features/changes, but a full audit is needed to ensure every major feature/change is covered and up to date.
- Enhancements.md and CHANGELOG.md exist and appear to be separated as required, but need to be checked for proper reconciliation and up-to-date status.
- API documentation is present in both Markdown and auto-generated HTML formats; should be checked for completeness and currency.
- Usage and configuration documentation is present in README.md and docs/USAGE.md; should be reviewed for clarity and completeness.
- Security, performance, and migration topics are mentioned in README.md and some implementation docs, but should be checked for coverage in all relevant areas.
- docs/README.md should be reviewed to ensure it provides a clear and current index to all documentation resources.

---

## Step 3: Review of Enhancements.md and CHANGELOG.md

### Findings
- Enhancements.md currently contains many completed items (marked as "Done" or "Complete") as well as in-progress features.
- According to project rules, Enhancements.md should only contain planned or in-progress enhancements/features. Completed items should be moved to CHANGELOG.md.
- CHANGELOG.md is comprehensive and up-to-date, with completed features, bug fixes, and changes documented.
- There is duplication of completed features between Enhancements.md and CHANGELOG.md.

### Action Items
1. Remove all completed items (marked as "Done" or "Complete") from Enhancements.md.
2. Ensure all completed features are summarized in CHANGELOG.md.
3. Leave only planned/in-progress enhancements in Enhancements.md (e.g., "MCP-Shield Security Integration").
4. Add a note to regularly reconcile these files to maintain compliance.

| 1Password/Secrets Management          | No dedicated implementation doc (see code, PRs, README)   | Documented in code/README, but consider adding a summary doc      |

### Coverage Notes
- Most major features/changes have a corresponding implementation doc in Implementation_Docs.
- Output Directory Configuration and Data Dictionary are documented elsewhere; consider referencing or moving docs for consistency.
- Some smaller features (e.g., 1Password integration) are documented in code/README but may benefit from a summary implementation doc.

### Next Actions
1. For each implementation doc, audit for the following required sections:
   - Overview and purpose
   - Technical design and architecture
   - Dependencies and requirements
   - Implementation details and code examples
   - Configuration and setup instructions
   - Testing approach and considerations
   - Security implications (if applicable)
   - Performance considerations
   - Migration steps (if needed)
2. Note any missing docs or incomplete sections for follow-up.
3. For features documented outside Implementation_Docs, either move/copy the doc or add a clear reference in Implementation_Docs.
4. Document all findings and action items in this work plan.

### Importance
Completing this audit ensures the documentation is fully ready for future development, reduces onboarding time, and supports robust, maintainable growth of the project.
