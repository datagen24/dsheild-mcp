# MCP Tool Object Migration Implementation Doc

## Overview
This document tracks the migration of all MCP tool definitions in `handle_list_tools` from dictionaries to proper `Tool` objects, as required by the MCP server framework. This change is necessary to resolve the `'dict' object has no attribute 'name'` error and ensure full compatibility with the MCP protocol.

## Rationale
- The MCP server expects all tools to be instances of the `Tool` class (from `mcp.types`), not plain dictionaries.
- Returning dictionaries causes runtime errors and prevents tool listing and invocation from working.
- Migrating to `Tool` objects ensures type safety, future compatibility, and proper server operation.

## Technical Steps
1. Update the import in `mcp_server.py`:
   ```python
   from mcp.types import Tool
   ```
2. Change the return type of `handle_list_tools` to `List[Tool]`.
3. For each tool definition in the list, replace the dictionary with a `Tool(...)` object, preserving all fields.
4. Test the server to ensure all tools are listed and callable.
5. Document the migration and update CI/CD to catch similar issues in the future.

## Migration Checklist
- [x] Update import for `Tool`
- [x] Update return type annotation
- [x] Convert all tool definitions to `Tool` objects
- [x] Test integration and tool listing
- [ ] Update CI/CD to include integration test for tool initialization

## Summary
- All MCP tool definitions have been migrated to use the `Tool` object.
- The server now lists and registers all tools correctly, and the previous runtime error is resolved.
- Data dictionary and threat intelligence summary tools are working as expected.
- The only remaining issue is Elasticsearch v9 compatibility, which will be tracked in a separate issue.
