- ✅ `get_campaign_timeline` - Build detailed attack timelines
- ✅ `compare_campaigns` - Compare multiple campaigns for similarities
- ✅ `detect_ongoing_campaigns` - Real-time detection of active campaigns
- ✅ `search_campaigns` - Search existing campaigns by criteria
- ✅ `get_campaign_details` - Comprehensive campaign information

#### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis (Week 3)
- ✅ **Pattern Recognition** - TTP detection, tool recognition, infrastructure patterns

- ✅ **Campaign Visualization** - Timeline, network graph, geographic map data

#### Phase 4: Integration & Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)
- ✅ **Enhanced Elasticsearch Queries** - Specialized correlation queries
- ✅ **Campaign Persistence** - Storage and version control
- ✅ **Performance Optimization** - Caching, indexing, parallel processing

### 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

#### Core Campaign Analysis Engine:
```python
class CampaignAnalyzer:
    """Core campaign analysis and correlation engine"""
    
    def correlate_events(self, seed_events, correlation_criteria, time_window):
        """Correlate events based on specified criteria"""
        
    def expand_indicators(self, seed_iocs, expansion_strategy):
        """Expand IOCs to find related indicators"""
        
    def build_campaign_timeline(self, correlated_events):
        """Build chronological timeline of campaign events"""
        
    def score_campaign(self, campaign_data):
        """Score campaign based on sophistication and impact"""
```

#### Multi-Stage Correlation Algorithm:
```python
def correlate_campaign_events(seed_events, correlation_config):
    # Stage 1: Direct IOC matches
    # Stage 2: Infrastructure correlation  
    # Stage 3: Behavioral correlation
    # Stage 4: Temporal correlation
    # Stage 5: Confidence scoring and filtering
```

#### Campaign Data Models:
```python
@dataclass
class Campaign:
    campaign_id: str
    confidence_score: float
    start_time: datetime
    end_time: datetime
    attack_vectors: List[str]
    related_indicators: List[str]
    suspected_actor: Optional[str]
```

### 🎯 **Correlation Capabilities**

**Correlation Methods:**
- **IP-based**: Same source IPs, IP ranges, ASNs
- **Infrastructure**: Shared domains, certificates, hosting
- **Behavioral**: Similar attack patterns, timing, TTPs
- **Temporal**: Time-based clustering and proximity
- **Geospatial**: Geographic correlation of attacks
- **Signature-based**: Malware families, tools, techniques

### 📊 **Usage Scenarios**

#### Scenario 1: Investigating Suspicious IP
```python
campaign = analyze_campaign(
    seed_indicators=["192.168.1.100"],
    time_range_hours=168,  # 1 week
    correlation_methods=["ip_correlation", "temporal_correlation"],
    min_confidence=0.7
)
# Results: Coordinated campaign with 50+ related IPs across 3 weeks
```

#### Scenario 2: IOC Expansion
```python
expanded_campaign = expand_campaign_indicators(
    campaign_id="campaign_abc123",
    expansion_depth=3,
    include_passive_dns=True
)
# Discovers: Related C2 infrastructure and additional malware samples
```

#### Scenario 3: Ongoing Campaign Detection
```python
ongoing_campaigns = detect_ongoing_campaigns(
    time_window_hours=24,
    min_event_threshold=15,
    correlation_threshold=0.8
)
# Identifies: 2 active campaigns requiring immediate attention
```

### 📁 **File Structure**
**New Files**: 17 files across `src/`, `tests/`, `examples/`, and `docs/`  
**Modified Files**: 5 existing files for integration  
**Dependencies**: 3 new dependencies (`networkx`, `scikit-learn`, `python-dateutil`)

### 🎯 **Success Metrics**
- [ ] **Campaign Detection**: Successfully correlate events into meaningful campaigns
- [ ] **IOC Expansion**: Expand indicators with >80% accuracy
- [ ] **Timeline Reconstruction**: Build accurate attack timelines
- [ ] **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common TTPs and tools
