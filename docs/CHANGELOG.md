### Changed
- **DataProcessor**: Now gracefully skips `None` events in `process_security_events`, improving robustness for invalid input data

### Fixed
- **MCP Server Config Loading Error Handling**: Fixed server crash when user configuration loading fails
  - Root cause: DShieldMCPServer constructor did not handle exceptions from `get_user_config()`, causing the server to crash if config loading failed
  - Solution: Added try-catch block in `__init__()` method to gracefully handle config loading errors
  - Behavior: Server now sets `self.user_config = None` and logs the error instead of crashing
  - Impact: Server remains functional even with configuration issues, improving reliability and testability
  - **Testing**: Fixed `test_server_error_handling` test to properly validate graceful error handling

- **Test Suite: 1Password and Config Loader Mocking**
  - Fixed persistent test failures caused by real 1Password CLI calls during test runs.
  - Root cause: Both the DShield client and the config loader instantiated `OnePasswordSecrets` directly, and the config loader's `_resolve_secrets` function recursively resolved all secrets using the real 1Password integration, bypassing test mocks.
  - Solution: All tests now patch `src.config_loader._resolve_secrets` to return the test config directly, in addition to patching `OnePasswordSecrets` and `get_config`. This ensures no real 1Password resolution occurs during tests.
  - Impact: Test suite is now fully isolated from external secrets and passes reliably. Enables safe, fast, and repeatable test runs for all modules that depend on secrets/configuration.

- **Campaign Analysis Seed Event Retrieval Bug**: Fixed seed event retrieval failure preventing campaign analysis
  - Resolves seed event retrieval failure in `_get_seed_events()` method
  - Fixed field mapping issues by adding ECS fields and `related.ip` field support
  - Simplified query logic to use individual filter dictionaries instead of complex bool queries
  - Added dynamic IP discovery for testing when seed IPs don't exist in data
  - Includes comprehensive test coverage in `dev_tools/test_campaign_analysis_debugging.py`
  - **Issue**: [#27](https://github.com/datagen24/dsheild-mcp/issues/27)
  - **PR**: [#35](https://github.com/datagen24/dsheild-mcp/pull/35)
  - **Impact**: Campaign analysis now works end-to-end with 6/6 tests passing (100% success rate)

- **Attack Report Generation Bug**: Fixed ValueError when processing events with no valid timestamps
  - Resolves `min() arg is an empty sequence` error in `generate_attack_report()`
  - Added `_calculate_time_range()` method with proper validation and fallback handling
  - Handles events with no timestamps, malformed timestamps, and empty lists
  - Includes comprehensive test coverage in `dev_tools/test_attack_report_fix.py`
  - **Issue**: [#24](https://github.com/datagen24/dsheild-mcp/issues/24)
  - **PR**: [#25](https://github.com/datagen24/dsheild-mcp/pull/25)

- **MCP Server Initialization Error**: Fixed JavaScript-style boolean values causing initialization failure
  - Resolves `"name 'true' is not defined"` error in tools/list method
  - Changes JavaScript-style `true` to Python-style `True` in required field definitions
  - Affects 6 campaign analysis tool definitions: analyze_campaign, expand_campaign_indicators, 
    get_campaign_timeline, compare_campaigns, search_campaigns, get_campaign_details
  - Ensures Claude can properly initialize and use the DShield MCP server
  - **Impact**: MCP server now initializes correctly and all tools are accessible
